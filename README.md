This project is a Super Hero Hunter App in which we use superheroAPI() of Marvel to fetch the records and details of all the superheroes along with some additional features. The whole project is built using HTML, CSS, bootstrap, and Vanilla Javascript.

On the first page fetches the API to load the superheros. After fetching an API the data is stored persistently in the browser's local storage.
Users can Mark their Favourite Super Heroes in the 'favorites' section. It is stored persistently in the browser's local storage.
Users can search for the Super Heroes by entering the name or searchable term in the Search Input. It shows a list of results as autocomplete suggestions, which upon clicking directs us to that particular superhero card with all the information provided by the Marvel API.

# !Note
Please wait for 15 seconds for the API to load properly as it is in the Free Tier. Then you can start searching.
If the search bar still doesn't work then just refresh the page 2 times & it'll work :)
